wordlist
========

Extremely simple RESTful word server in Flask. 
The JSON object { "Word": "random word" } when invoked.
JavaScript for an Octopress aside to call the service is included.
This is intended as the simplest example of a RESTful service, together with a jQuery ajax call to invoke it.

A demo is available  at [Public Sphere][1]
